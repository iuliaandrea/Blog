    Spain is a storied country of stone castles, snowcapped mountains, vast monuments, and sophisticated cities, all of which have made it a favoured travel destination. The country is geographically and culturally diverse. Its heartland is the Meseta, a broad central plateau half a mile above sea level. Much of the region is traditionally given over to cattle ranching and grain production; it was in this rural setting that Miguel de Cervantesâ€™s Don Quixote tilted at the tall windmills that still dot the landscape in several places.

    Unlike any other shaorma sellers, such as romanians, turkish people do it better. They have unique ingredients that make their food taste so much better. Satu mare is lucky, we have several restaurants that serve this type of food and the prices ar actually accessible.
